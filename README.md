# Sample Professional Portfolio

## Description
    The goal of this project was to create a mini/sample professional portfolio using HTML and CSS. This project was an opportunity to showcase everything learned so far as no starter code was provided. The initial steps consisted of planning the layout of the webpage, followed by creating the skeleton of said page using HTML elements and text. A nav bar with functioning links was created to highlight important sections of the page (about me, work, and contact). Placeholder images were added to function as project images while placeholder links were added to function as deployed application links. Finally, a footer was included to think visitors for browsing the portfolio. CSS styling was incorporated to bring the webpage to life through various colors and fonts. Additionally, CSS classes and IDs also helped to align/organize various sections of the page using dimensions, margins, padding, Flexbox properties, and etc. Finally, media queries were utilized to ensure webpage responsiveness across screens of various proportions.
